# Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression

In this project, I work with housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa, the United States from 2006 to 2010. The data set contains 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory variables involved in assessing home value.

I use the linear regression model to predict the sale price.
